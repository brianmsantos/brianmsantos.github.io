                <h5>I'm a San Diego native mostly. I did move around as a child 
                    due to the fact of my family being in the military. This made
                    it hard to keep the same friends growing up but I found different
                    ways of keeping myself busy. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was always a curious child with quite an imagination. I did the 
                    usual Lego building and drawing and was always curious on how things
                    worked. I liked to take apart things and put them back together. When 
                    computers became more prominent I became more curious and fascinated
                    with them and how the whole thing worked. I ended up getting my business 
                    degree but I am back full circle to computers. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My curiosity and always wanting to learn something new and 
                    satisfying brought me to learning web development. I am now able to 
                    combine the passion of building things and affinity for technology 
                    together in my career with web development.
